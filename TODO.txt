rewrite the editor
    - visual editor is not that good of an idea, the argument of each proof want and should be small
    - can be change to compile latex when needed or even rewrite the latex renderer
    - need a structure parser for argument
    - design a formal language, programming language-like for writing such proof 
    - compile on input, need some suitable way for optimizing this, especially on long equaitons


Equation helper and macros
    - understand how latex work deeply
    - make writing equations and linking them becomes easier 

Add more structure and more customizable choices
    - implicit linking, add background node
    - allow user to customize color
    - custom macros but more like meta-programming 


Understand simple proofs
    - building concepts and principles needed 
    - allow create axioms
    - implcit inference rules
